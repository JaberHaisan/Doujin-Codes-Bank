# Doujin-Codes-Bank
You can store and use stored codes from doujin sites using this script. 

Currently these websites are supported: nhentai.net, hentainexus.net

The code for a link can be found at the end of that link. For e.g. in "nhentai.net/g/1234567" the code is
1234567.

The default site for codes is nhentai. To change the site, enter the keyword for that site in the prompt
(Available keywords are shown at the top of the prompt). Codes are saved in a text file in the same
directory as the script. 

To use your stored codes, enter 'c' in the prompt. Afterwards enter the 
number of codes you want to withdraw. For each withdrawn code a tab is opened in 
your default browser. After withdrawal, the code is removed from the text file.

Please enter 'q' to exit after entering codes to exit. Otherwise the written codes will not be saved.
(The codes are also saved if you enter 'c')
