# Doujin-Codes-Bank
You can store and use stored codes from doujin sites using this script.
Currently these websites are supported: nhentai.net, hentainexus.net

Please enter 'q' to exit after entering codes to exit. Otherwise the written codes will not be saved.
The default site for codes is nhentai. To change the site, enter the keyword for that site in the prompt
(Available keywords are shown at the top of the prompt).

The codes are stored in a text file called "Codes.txt". To use your stored codes, enter 'c' in the prompt and enter the 
number of codes you want to withdraw. For each withdrawn code a tab is opened in your default browser. After withdrawal,
the code is removed from the text file.
